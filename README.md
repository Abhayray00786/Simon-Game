**STEPS TO PLAY**

Press any key to START. 

Simon will give the first signal. 
Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.

Simon will add another signal . 
Repeat these two signal one after another, in order.

Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.

Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly....

After few times it gets difficult to follow up the correct orders of singals:(

If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
